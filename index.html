								<h2><a href="#">GREAT Respondents Come in the Form of 10 Year Old Kids who Watch TV</a></h2>
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>If quantitative research asks the what, qualitative asks the why. I can ask about what yogurt flavor my customer loves in a quantitative survey, but how do I learn why she loves that flavor? 
<br><br>
									I learn by finding outstanding respondents.
<br><br>								
									What experience do I have that other people do not? I walk alongside respondents from start to finish. Recruitment until payment. A nobody-turned-valuable-respondent. What insights has this given me? I know what makes a GREAT respondent and what makes a BAD respondent. 
								<br><br>									
									I remember recruiting for a study about kids TV shows. For the majority of the screener, I chatted on the phone with the kid’s mom. For 15 minutes, I asked her question after question about the kid’s habits on the TV. What shows does he watch? How many hours per week does he sit in front of the TV? How much does he like this show? What about this other show? I could tell that she really wanted her kid to be in the study, so she thought about her responses for a few moments before saying them out loud.
									<br><br>								
									Then, I asked mom to put the kid on the phone. I hear a 10 year old boy’s voice tentatively say, “hello?”
									<br><br>								
									“Hi Brian! My name is Davey. Is it ok if I ask you three easy questions about your favorite TV shows?”
									<br><br>									
									“TV? Yes!” Brian quickly responded.
									<br><br>									
									For the next three minutes, I experienced a rare thing in the world of recruitment. The 10 year old boy answered my questions without hesitation, with superb articulation, and most importantly, with 100% honesty. It was incredibly refreshing. There was no need to probe deeper after I asked a question. I had finally found a GREAT respondent: a 10 year old boy.
									<br><br>									
									Unfortunately, when the 10 year old boy came in for the actual group, he was like most every 10 year old kid. Informative, but distracted. Perfectly clear in his responses, but could not sit still.
									<br><br>									
									So, this is not to say that 10 year old kids are objectively better respondents than adult respondents. BUT, 10 year old kids have some GREAT qualities. And we need to look for these qualities in our adult respondents:
									<br><br>									
									-Responses with little to no hesitation<br>
									-Excitement about the topic<br>
									-Quick and clear answers to questions
									<br><br>									
									BAD adult respondents have an agenda. They want to participate in a study about yogurt flavors even when they have only tried the flavor one time. These respondents want the money. They aren’t familiar with the topic. But more times than not, these BAD respondents find their way into a study by bypassing oblivious recruiters.
									<br><br>								
									Find GREAT respondents. Find respondents who are like 10 year old kids.

								<h2><a href="#">Articulation Question or Demeanor Checkpoint?</a></h2>

Recruiters consistently fail in one category: the articulation question. The articulation question is designed to test a respondent’s ability to successfully participate in a focus group. Can the respondent clearly articulate their thoughts? Do they talk too much, too little, or with a bad attitude? In most screeners, the articulation question is mindlessly tacked on at the end. From the perspective of a recruiter, the late placement renders the question useless. A recruiter is extremely unlikely to disqualify a respondent after completing a 20-minute screener solely on the basis of a below-average answer to the articulation question. 
<br><br>
Instead, articulation should be an aspect of a larger category.
<br><br>
Demeanor.
<br><br>
The demeanor of a focus group respondent includes their ability to articulate their thoughts, but more importantly, it includes their ability to participate in a group where other people are also articulating their thoughts. Will this respondent dominate the conversation, shy away from it, or have a bad attitude throughout the entire group? Will their tone of voice be harsh or negative? Ask any moderator, and they have endured multiple groups with this type of respondent (or even kicked them out of the group). It is easy to agree that a group influenced by a respondent with a negative demeanor is a waste of money for any company.
<br><br>
To change the futility of the articulation question, companies need to emphasize the importance of demeanor throughout the entire screener. Not just the very end. The entire thing. Recruiters deserve the freedom to exercise judgement about a respondent’s demeanor. The recruiter (not the company) is the only person who has interacted with the respondents before they arrive for a group. Companies need to provide checkpoints in the screener for “demeanor checks.” 
<br><br>
For example, it would look something like this:
<br><br>
Q. 1<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
Q. 5 What is your age?<br>
18-25…………………...TERMINATE<br>
26-35…………………...Continue<br>
36-45…………………...Continue<br>
46+……………………...TERMINATE<br>
<br><br>
Demeanor Check: Is the respondent in a rush? Do they sound frustrated in any way? <br>
No…………………...Continue<br>
Yes…………………..TERMINATE<br>
<br><br>
Demeanor checks throughout the screener are important. In the long run, they will cut costs and reduce the chance that your company will be embarrassed by a rude and toxic respondent.
<br><br>
I will end with one thought. I can recruit the most spectacular respondent - one that all the clients in the backroom tune in to hear. She articulates her feelings with clarity, freely describes why she loves a certain yogurt flavor but steers clear of another one, and engages in the conversation from start to finish. BUT, if she does not feel welcomed and respected in the group, she will respond in that same way. This is where the ultimate burden lies on the moderator. From the first minute that the respondents step into the room, it is imperative that the moderator establish an atmosphere of comfort and respect in the room. Imperative. A fantastic moderator can empower an average respondent to offer valuable insights, but an uninterested and lazy moderator will sabotage any possibility of insights from the most terrific respondent.

		As a recruiter, I make sure to declare the incentive in my first sentence.
		<br><br>
		“Hi Molly, we have a focus group coming up which will offer $150 for 2 hours of your time. Are you interested?”
		<br><br>
		I declare the incentive quickly because of an assumption: respondents are in it for the money.
		<br><br>
		Am I correct in this assumption? Yes. But I am not fully correct.
		<br><br>
		During recruitment, I am able to see HH income ranges for each respondent. The yearly income for most respondents falls somewhere between $35,000 and $70,000 per year. Picture a mother of two kids. All of the money she makes is put towards her two kids. Any disposable income to spend on herself is difficult to come by. So, if she participated in two focus groups last year and received $300-$400 total, she could feel the freedom to finally spend some money on herself. 
		<br><br>
		But, a substantial portion of our respondent base makes over $150,000 per year. $300-$400 is less impactful on their everyday lives. So, are these respondents in it only for the money? Unlikely.
		<br><br>
		I have carefully listened to the conversations of respondents when they walk into and out of groups. What do I hear? 
		<br><br>
		“Hey, that was actually a really interesting conversation. Maybe I actually influenced the company’s decision making process!”
		<br>“The moderator made that group really fun. I loved sharing what I thought about each of the drinks that we tried.”
		<br>“It was nice to meet you today in the group. You had some insightful thoughts!”
		<br><br>
		People enjoy having a voice. America in the digital age does not always give people that voice. Millions of people are simultaneously fighting for attention, and voices can easily get lost and muddled. At a focus group, opinions are valued. Voices are acknowledged. People feel heard.
		<br><br>
		In the future, I will be changing my introductory sentence.
		<br><br>
		“Hi Molly, we have a focus group coming up which will offer $150 for 2 hours of your time. All you have to do is offer your honest and valuable opinions!”
